<div class="bio-container">
<h1>Biography</h1>
<p>James Cliff is a professional in the music industry with more than 7 years of experience beginning with the creation of his DJ business known as "Velocity Music DJ Company". James learned how to mix tracks by using professional software such as <a href="https://serato.com" class="links">Serato</a> and <a href="https://www.virtualdj.com" class="links">VirtualDJ</a>, which acted as training wheels for his transition to producing his own tracks using some of the most popular Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs), such as Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro" class="links">Logic Pro</a>, Avid's <a href="https://www.avid.com/pro-tools" class="links">Pro Tools</a>, and Ableton's <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live" class="links">Live Suite</a> (James's preferred DAW). Cliff's career as a DJ provided him with the necessary tools to be able to produce his own tracks on a professional level.</p>

<p>James is currently a sophomore studying Interactive Digital Media at the Westphal College of Media Arts and Design at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA. While he is focused on becoming a UI/UX Designer, his free time is spent focusing on his other forms of media. With a history of music production, graphic design, and web design, he has taken advantage of the opportunity to combine his interests and become a creator of multiple forms of media.
